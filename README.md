## Known caveats && issues
Dockbrew is in pre-alpha release state, it leverage docker to unclutter your MacOSX host. You first need to run a docker-host locally on your Mac host (`docker-machine` comes in handy, jusr run `docker-machine create dockbrew -d virtualbox && eval "$(docker-machine env dockbrew)"`)
